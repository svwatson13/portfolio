# Terminal Themed Website

It replicates the terminal feel, inside of a website. You could use this for a portfolio, or just for fun! It has various commands such as `wfetch`, `clear`. You can add more as this whole project is open source and under the MIT Licence.

## Customize

To change some of the styling you can change the variables in /css/style.scss and recompile it into css.
To change the commands, and other functionality go to /js/main.js, Currently a bit of documentation has been created, simply [click this link](https://github.com/woooferz/terminalweb/wiki).

## Inspiration

I was inspired to create this project by 2 things [LiveTerm](https://liveterm.vercel.app/) ([Source Code](https://github.com/Cveinnt/LiveTerm)) and ForrestKnight's [fkcode.com](https://fkcodes.com/) (As of writing this it is not working).
